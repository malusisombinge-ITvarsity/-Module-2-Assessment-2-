             <h3>PLOT</h3>
             
             <p>In 1963 Montana, retired sheriff George Blackledge and his wife Margaret live with their son James, his wife, Lorna, and their newborn grandson, Jimmy. One day while James is out riding his horse, Lorna readies a sink bath for Jimmy. While bathing Jimmy, the wild horse comes running back through the farm without James. George finally finds James dead alongside a creek. It is assumed that he died from being thrown from the horse, breaking his neck.</p>
             
             <p>Three years later, Lorna marries Donnie Weboy. While out one day, Margaret see Donnie physically abusing both his wife and now 3-year-old Jimmy. Margaret decides to check in with Lorna and Jimmy at their new home. Shortly afterwards, Donnie leaves town with Lorna and Jimmy, causing Margaret to worry over Jimmy’s safety. She eventually convinces George that the situation is dire enough to intervene, and the two set off to find the family.</p>
             
             <p>Various sources clue them into the whereabouts of the Weboy family, until finally Margaret and George locate Donnie's uncle, Bill Weboy. Their initial meeting is cold, but Margaret refuses to be intimidated and accepts Bill's invitation to the Weboy's homestead for dinner. At dinner, they meet Donnie’s family, including Blanche, Donnie’s intimidating and disturbing mother. Her charms do not last long as the dinner conversation progresses and an attempt from Margaret to carry Jimmy out of the house turns sour. Not feeling welcome anymore, they leave the Weboy house.</p>
             
             <p>George and Margaret meet Lorna at work the next day, and convince her to leave with them. She then plans to leave her home at midnight, and tells them to wait for her at their hotel. At midnight, instead of Lorna, the Weboys having supposedly caught Lorna sneaking out, visit George and Margaret at the hotel. Margaret tries to convince Blanche by telling her about the physical abuse he did to Lorna and her child, but Blanche instead tells Donnie to hit Margaret. George intervenes and later pulls out his pistol but is overpowered by the Weboys and the fingers of his right hand are hacked off by them with a hatchet.</p>
             
             <p>The local police sheriff takes side with the Weboys and tells George to leave. They do so but due to George's health, have to make a stop at Peter's house, who is a young Native American man they had met while on the way to the Weboys' estate. Later that night, George takes the car and leaves for the Weboys house alone. After acquiring a shotgun from their house and starting a fire as a distraction, he attempts to help Lorna escape. He keeps Donnie, who was sleeping beside her, on gunpoint and asks her to leave. Donnie lays quiet but the others are awakened by the smell of fire, Bill comes out of his room and stops Lorna and Jimmy in the upstairs hallway. He takes Jimmy from Lorna and pushes her down the stairs. George points his gun at Bill but Blanche comes hurriedly out the room with her pistol, but accidentally kills Bill, and then shoots George. The Weboy brothers appear, but George takes control of Blanche's gun and kills them.</p>
             
             <p>Margaret and Peter, who had followed George on horseback, receive Lorna outside the Weboy house. They then go to help George out of the house, but are stopped by Blanche. Blanche shoots and kills George. With Peter's help, Margaret kills Blanche with the shotgun. She then takes Lorna and leaves in the car, with the Weboy house burning in the wake. The movie ends with Margaret, Lorna, and Jimmy leaving the town of Gladstone in the car.</p>
